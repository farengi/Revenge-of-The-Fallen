# Programmable Matter Simulation: Revenge of the Fallen

## Overview

This project implements a simulation of programmable matter, a collection of intelligent agents that can rearrange themselves to form different target shapes. The system simulates the problem as a state-space search problem, where each agent must find a path from its initial position to its target position while avoiding obstacles and other agents.

The project was developed for the Intelligent Engineering Algorithms (COE 544/744) course at Lebanese American University, Spring 2025.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Search Algorithms**: A* (default), Breadth-First Search, and Greedy algorithms
- **Two Topology Options**: Von Neumann (4 directions) and Moore (8 directions) neighborhoods
- **Two Control Modes**: 
  - Centralized: A single controller plans paths for all elements
  - Distributed: Each element makes independent movement decisions
- **Movement Types**:
  - Sequential: Elements move one at a time
  - Parallel: Multiple elements can move simultaneously
- **Target Shapes**: Square, Circle, Triangle, and Heart formations
- **Deadlock Detection and Resolution**: Advanced mechanisms to detect and resolve movement conflicts
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Real-time visualization with parameter controls

## Technical Implementation

### PEAS Conceptual Model

As per the project requirements, we've defined the PEAS (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) model for our agents:

**Performance Measures**:
- Minimizing the number of moves required to form the target shape
- Minimizing the number of node explorations for efficient pathfinding
- Maximizing the percentage of elements successfully reaching their targets
- Minimizing deadlocks and resolving conflicts efficiently

**Environment**:
- A 2D grid with customizable dimensions (default 10x10)
- Boundaries/walls that cannot be traversed
- Other elements that cannot be co-located with the current element
- Target positions defining the goal formation

**Actuators**:
- Movement in four directions (Von Neumann) or eight directions (Moore)
- Ability to wait in place when optimal

**Sensors**:
- Knowledge of the entire grid state (centralized mode)
- Knowledge of immediate surroundings and target position (distributed mode)
- Detection of neighboring elements and walls
- Path detection algorithms

### Algorithms Implementation

1. **A* Search**: Optimal pathfinding using Manhattan distance heuristic
2. **Breadth-First Search**: Complete search guaranteeing the shortest path
3. **Greedy Search**: Fast but potentially suboptimal pathfinding using direct distance heuristic

### Deadlock Resolution

The project includes sophisticated deadlock detection and resolution mechanisms:
- Pattern recognition for oscillating movements
- Identification of mutual blocking scenarios
- Temporary path deviation to resolve deadlocks
- Priority-based conflict resolution

## Usage

1. Select a faction theme (Autobot or Decepticon)
2. Choose a target shape (Square, Circle, Triangle, or Heart)
3. Configure the algorithm, topology, movement type, and control mode
4. Adjust the number of agents using the slider
5. Click "Transform" to start the simulation
6. Monitor progress through the console output and metrics display
7. Use "Reset" to return to the initial state

## Implementation Notes

### Centralized vs. Distributed Control

In centralized mode, the system:
- Computes complete paths for all elements before execution
- Prioritizes elements based on their positions and distances to targets
- Resolves potential collisions by adjusting the execution order

In distributed mode, each element:
- Makes independent decisions based on local information
- Detects and responds to potential deadlocks
- Yields to higher-priority elements in conflict situations

### Topology Considerations

- Von Neumann topology: Simpler movement patterns but more likely to create deadlocks
- Moore topology: More movement options but higher computational complexity

## Experimental Results

Performance varies based on configuration:
- A* consistently outperforms other algorithms in terms of move efficiency
- Parallel movement is faster but more prone to conflicts
- Distributed control with Moore topology achieves high success rates for complex shapes
- Heart shape works optimally with exactly 12 agents

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning integration for improved heuristics
- Multi-layer formations with 3D visualization
- Dynamic obstacle environments
- More complex shape transformations
